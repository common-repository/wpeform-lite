The best features of our form builder includes

- 100% **Mobile and Container responsive**. No matter what device or what area of your theme, forms _will_ look good. The grid of the form responds to the width of the container it is placed in.
- With latest shadow dom technology, your forms will look the same, no matter what the theme. If you want, you can turn this feature off.
- View **your submissions from WordPress admin**, right from the free plan. That's right, we don't block viewing submissions behind a paywall. Apart from email notifications, you always have the option to view it from the admin area.
- Keep your [forms private](https://www.wpeform.io/docs/getting-started/form-builder/#adding-editors-to-form?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=lite) in WordPress and share with only the WordPress users you trust.
- Very **modern form builder**, built with TypeScript/React and a GraphQL API.
- You can **edit form submissions** from admin. You can even let (with limitations) submitting users edit their submissions.
- Comes with **many color schemes**. If you don't like them, you can always create your own with our handy color picker.
- All form elements' label, description, title etc are **rich text based**. Change colors, format text, insert images, videos, there is absolutely no limitations.
- **Multi paged forms** are treated as first-class citizens. Large forms should be split into multiple pages and WPEForm makes it easier than ever.
- **Personality tests** with multi tiered outcomes. You can create buzz feed like quizzes without hiring a developer.

You will like all the more form elements, integrations, newsletter and payment functionalities.

We understand that **a form is like a mini application**. It needs to be interactive, responsive and fast. Our whole product is centered around these ideas.

### Live Form Builder with Drag and Drop

Our form builder is the first of its kind for WordPress. It built on top of a **GraphQL API** with **TypeScript/React**. We want the form builder to be super fast and intuitive, giving you the best possible User Experience (UX). You spend more time building your forms, not fighting the Form Builder.

* Add any number of pages or tabs to the form.
* Add any number of elements to the page.
* Align form elements in columns of custom sizes on different breakpoints.
* Easily access form settings from sidebars.

In the video above, we see a full tutorial to create [this form](https://prod.wpeform.io/wp-eform/form/starter-exhibition-event-feedback-form/12/) in under 8 minutes. Install now and see for yourself. Our whole powerful form builder is available from the **FREE** plan. We didn't put any performance features behind paywall.

### Pre Built Form Templates

We have included many form templates to help you get started right away. You do not always need to start from scratch. Most of the form templates are available right inside the New Form Wizard. More templates can be viewed and downloaded from our <a href="https://www.wpeform.io/examples/?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=lite" rel="friend" title="Examples - WPEForm - WordPress Form Builder">Examples page</a>.

### Tier based Personality Quizzes

You can have any number of Score Tiers, like personality scores. All WPEForm elements can have scores assigned to them. Depending on the choice of the user you can add any score to any of the tiers.

This gives you 100% flexibility on how scores are calculated. See [this form](https://prod.wpeform.io/wp-eform/form/free-personality-quiz/9/) for an example.

All the above comes **FREE** with WPEForm. With **STARTER** plan you can put timers per page (or overall), record submission time and show graphs of different tiers of submissions. See [this example](https://prod.wpeform.io/wp-eform/system/summary/?mode=preview&token=8d6d80fd3547dc2b3de94c4039f73051).

### Browse Form Entries

With WPEForm Lite (and of course premium) you always get to see list of submissions made by your users. Whenever someone submits the form, it gets saved in your WordPress database and shows up in WPEForm administrative area.

Just go to WPEForm / Submissions and see all entries and leads. You can view or edit the entries or delete them.

### Form Landing Pages optimized for distraction free Conversion

Right from our free plan, you get standalone, landing pages. Just click on the Preview button and copy the URL. See [this form](https://prod.wpeform.io/wp-eform/form/starter-purchase-product-with-addons/24/) as an example. With the upcoming professional version, you will be able to customize more of the landing page, without writing any code. Just like google forms or typeforms, but right inside your very own WordPress.

### 25+ Form Elements to choose from

WPEForm comes with all the form elements you could think of and more. We are in active development of form elements, so you will almost never run out of options. And if you do, we humbly ask that you let us know and we will do our best to bring it to the next version.

The **FREE** version of WPEForm comes with basic sets of form elements, namely
Radio, Checkbox, Dropdown, Text, TextArea, a few design elements like Heading, Question Group, Article and the Captcha security element. These should be enough for anyone just starting out with contact forms.

As your requirements grow, you can upgrade WPEForm to one of the paid plans and gain access to more form elements. Right now, we've released the **STARTER** plan which has the following extra elements (on top of everything available from the **FREE** version): Toggle, Math output, Slider, Range, Rating, Matrix Choice, Matrix Input, DateTime, Slider Group, Range Group, Rating Group, Math Group, Sortable, Stacked Group and Address.

Stay tuned as we release more form elements tailored to solve your problems.

### Truly responsive form design

WPEForm forms are truly responsive. They respect the size of the container you put them in. This is very helpful when you place the forms in narrow widgets or footers or popups. They just look good and work.

An example to attention to detail would be our **Dropdown Element**. It is available from **FREE** plan and very unique. When viewed from mobile it shows a pop-up type dropdown near the thumb of your user. When viewed from desktop, it shows a regular dropdown.

You also get many form themes which would work with any WordPress theme out there (more on this later). If you do not like our color schemes, you can always make your own.

Lastly in the **STARTER** plan, there's a **Dark Mode** feature. When enabled, the form will response to the visitor's preference and turn on dark mode for itself.

### 100% Conflict free with any themes or plugins

We are using latest Web Technologies with WPEForm. The goal is to give a form that looks the same no matter which WordPress theme you are using. For this we've leveraged the [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) API. It just ensures that CSS coming from your theme or any other plugin doesn't interfere with WPEForm and vice-versa.

As long as your website doesn't produce any JavaScript error on the page our forms are guaranteed to work.

By the way, if you want your theme to override WPEForm styles, you can turn this feature off from Site Settings of WPEForm.

### Best in class administration

WPEForm comes with exhaustive administration features. We've included everything you need to administrate the submissions. If you think something is missing, then do let us know and we will do our best to add it.

* View and Edit submissions from WordPress admin.
* Get notified and notify your users when someone submits a form.
* Categorize forms for easy access and filter.

and much more. Install now to see them in action.

### Share forms with multiple users

By default a form is scoped to the WordPress user who created it. In the default configuration

1. Administrators and Editors can create forms.
1. Editors can view only the forms they have created and their submissions.
1. Administrators and editors can share the form with other admins and editors.
1. Shared forms give privilege to view/edit form and submissions.

This works great for a network of form authors. In future we will add capabilities editor so that you can choose who exactly can create forms regardless of their WordPress role.

### Powerful Conditional Logic System

Any form builder is useless without logical steps. WPEForm treats conditional logic as first-class citizen. With our system you can

1. Show or hide individual form elements or groups or pages;
1. Set value of other elements;

Depending on the value (or values) of the source element.

The logical system is split into two things:

1. Events - You choose combination (with _AND_ or _OR_ operators) of events.
2. Consequences - If the event was successful, you fire up consequences.

### Headless Form Mode

This is the very first in WordPress. Our Forms are basically react app with a GraphQL API. So we've made a way, you can run WPEForm in headless mode. Just add one config in your `wp-config.php` and we are good to go. Some use cases includes:

1. Make your forms in your WordPress site and render on your static sites.
2. Use your own form library and communicate with the GraphQL API to send submissions.
3. Render forms on your React applications, GatsbyJS site or Next.js sites.

The possibilities are endless and we are just getting started. Be sure to read our [documentation website](https://www.wpeform.io/docs/advanced-topics/headless-mode/) to learn how you can setup headless mode and start using forms in your react applications today.

This feature is totally opt-in and is disable by default. You do not have to worry about security concerns because by default the GraphQL API is hardened with a nonce verification. If you do enable headless mode, it will run with anonymous user when sending submissions. We've made sure the API is super secure, with 100s of automated tests. But of course we are also human. Should something bad happens, we will be prompt to patch it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find documentation? =

Updated version of documentation can always be found at [WPEForm Knowledge-base](https://www.wpeform.io/docs/?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=lite)

= Is this WPEForm translation ready?

Yes, both server side and client side assets are translation ready. All po, mo and json files should go inside the `languages` directory. We have included sample po, mo and json files from where you can copy and start translating. Detailed instruction can be found in [our documentation website](https://www.wpeform.io/docs/advanced-topics/translate-wpeform-your-language/).

= Why should I choose WPEForm? =

You _may_ choose WPEForm if:

- You are a business owner, looking to create high converting forms.
- You are a developer, looking to create beautiful forms for your clients.
- You have a personal blog, where you want a good looking form.
- You are a photographer, looking to collect feedbacks from your viewers and customers.

- You need a health record form to keep track of your patients or clients.

you get the idea. If our drag and drop form builder cannot solve your requirements, let us know and we will make sure it does.

= What types of Forms can I create with WPEForm? =

Basically every kinds of forms can be made with WPEForm.

- Contact forms.
- Website survey and feedback forms.
- Business and operations forms.
- Payment forms.
- Cost estimator forms.
- Event management and booking forms.
- Employee request forms.

Do visit our [examples page](https://www.wpeform.io/examples/?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=lite) for more form templates.

= Do I need to know coding? =

Not at all. The primary goal of WPEForm is to help you create forms, without needing to write any code. With WPEForm you have access to a live, drag and drop form builder. Just visualize and build your forms. Very much like the new and excellent block editor WordPress offers.

= Can I import/export forms between my sites =

Yes. Right from admin dashboard, you get the option to export your form as a `json` file. Then on the new form wizard, you get another option to import from the json file. It is that easy.

= I am stuck, where can I get support? =

Please visit our [support page](https://www.wpeform.io/contact/?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=lite).

= What is this GraphQL thing WPEForm is built with? =

I am very glad you asked this question. Traditionally many plugins are built where the server would send the HTML needed to render a plugin's output. This technique is very well suited for SEO related contents, like your blog posts. But, rendering forms with this technique can severely slow down the server. **A form is like a mini application**. It needs to be interactive, fast and very responsive.

A better suited way is to let the server deal only with the form data (very similar to the json file you get when you download an export code of a form). Let the client, i.e, your users browser render the form. This approach is sometimes called JAMStack. Where we deal with JavaScript, API and Markup. This is very new and very hot. Personally I wanted to bring this to WordPress. I also made a tooling [wpack.io](https://wpack.io) to make this easier for WordPress developer.

So I choose GraphQL to deal with the API part and React to render forms and manage application. This way, the server remains very fast. It does not have to do anything with application logic, just the very important business logic. The client also remains fast, because with GraphQL API, it just gets the data it needs, and not a single byte more.

With this API based development approach, we now can offer you, for the first time in WordPress, headless forms. Make your forms in your WordPress Admin. Then use our client library to render your forms on static websites, like Gatsby, nextjs, or basically anywhere.

= Where can I find the source code? =

The human readable PHP source code is available in this repository. The JavaScript code can be found at [@wpeform/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wpeform/react) npm repository. We will very soon separate all our components and put it on GitHub for other open source usage.
